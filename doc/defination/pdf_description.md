## Description 


The restaurant wants to launch its software system with new design elements that take customer orders, send the orders to the kitchen, monitor goods sold and inventory, and generate reports for management. The restaurant’s software system needs an efficient food-ordering system to keep track of all the activities of the restaurant. The first process at the Yummy Pizza is that customers should be able to browse through the extensive menu available using computer displays available at the restaurant or printed menus available at the restaurant. 
The pizzas come in three sizes i.e., Small (8 Inch), Large (11 Inch) and Extra Large (12 Inch). 
At Yummy’s pizza one can be ordered with traditional, wholemeal and gluten free bases. 
Customers can also choose between tomato sauce or BBQ sauce for their pizza order. The menu has different pizza topping options i.e., supreme, sausage sizzle, Hawaiian, chicken and veggie lovers’ pizza. 
Further, each type of pizza topping has different subtypes e.g., the chicken pizza can be of type sweet chilli chicken or periperi chicken. The veggie lovers’ pizza can be of type garden goodness or vegan cheese. In the menu each pizza choice further displays the calorie intake of each item, key ingredients and the price. 
The customers also have different add-on or side options i.e., pasta, chicken wings garlic bread and drinks. 
There are two pasta options available at Yummy pizza i.e. creamy mushroom pasta and classic Bolognese pasta. There are different choices of soft drinks as well as fruit juices available at Yummy Pizza.




The customers should be able to order at the counter, through phone or online. 
The next process in the system is to receive or get the customer’s Food Order either verbally (e.g., “Give me two 2 of 6 small supreme pizzas, one garlic bread, and one regular Coke”) or as an online order. 
This received customer order needs to be transformed into a form meaningful to the kitchen’s system. 
It also needs to be transformed into a printed receipt for the customer. 
Thirdly, it needs to be transformed into goods sold data. Inventory data also needs to be updated as the order will reduce ingredients stored in inventory. The customer order is not complete until the customer makes the required payment. The payment can be done by cash or by debit and credit card. 

The students at yummy pizzas are given a 10% discount on their order. The discount can be only received by showing the student card.

The group bookings apply to a minimum of six people and a maximum of twenty people. The group booking is only done or confirmed if the customer pays $100 in advance by cash or credit.

At the end of each day, Rob generates an inventory report that tells him how much inventory should have been used for each item associated with a sale. The steps involved in Rob’s inventory control system are as follows: Firstly, meet delivery trucks before opening the restaurant. After this, upload and store deliveries. He needs to upload invoices into the system and update the amounts received to the stock. He also needs to pay bills that are due and record them as paid. The process of ordering food items and other items for the restaurant also needs to be automated. If an item is perishable, such as meat, vegetables, or bread, the Murphy’s have a standing order with a local supplier that a pre-specified amount of food is delivered each weekday for that day’s use and each Saturday for weekend use. If the item is not perishable, such as straws, cups, and napkins, an order is placed when the stock on hand reaches a certain predetermined minimum order quantity. The sales of the restaurant are also dependent on the season of the year. Pizza business is not good during the summer months when students are off campus. Thus, the standing orders with their suppliers are reduced by specified amounts during the summer and holiday breaks. Yummy Pizza’s software system also displays staff vacancies or vacant positions. The vacancies are also advertised in a local paper. The jobseekers or prospective employees of yummy pizzas can apply for vacant positions at yummy pizzas either online or by post. The management team keeps or maintains a weekly roaster for all the staff. Its super-supportive management teams offer work hours that can fit around staff commitments, like university study, sporting events or family commitments. To help young employees balance work and study, restaurant has flexible rostering system can accommodate exam periods and other important activities. Yummy pizza’s top menu is also enjoyed by all the staff members through an exclusive employee discount card which offer fantastic discounts on restaurant’s food i.e., 50% discount on a meal during, before or after each shift, Yummy Pizzas also publishes a monthly newsletter in which it gives information about new pizza 3 of 6 menu options and monthly specials.
